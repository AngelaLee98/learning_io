# Importing Only Lines From a Caption File

This repo is for self-learning on 'file i/o' using Java. 

I wanted a tool that imports lines that are written in Japanese from a caption file. 


This tool does the below actions with the basic grammar of Java : 

    ✔️Reads a caption file
    
    ✔️Collects lines from the file
    
    ✔️Creates a new file
    
    ✔️Exports collected lines to the new file# learning_io
